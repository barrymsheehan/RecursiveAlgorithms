# Recursive Algorithms

A collection of simple algorithms with both iterative and recursive implementations.

## About

Iterative and recursive implementations of each algorithm are provided side by
side within the same class for easy comparison. It is interesting to see how
some iterative algorithms can be implemented using recursion.

### Compatibility

The program was written working with Java 8. (1.8.0_212). It has not been tested in any other environment.

## Algorithms

### Euclidean Algorithm - EuclideanAlgorithm class

Calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive whole numbers.

### Calculate Factorial - Factorial class

Calculates the factorial of a positive whole number.

### Calculate nth number in the Fibonacci sequence - Fibonacci class

Calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

### Reverse a String - ReverseString class

Returns the input String, reversed with a "|" character between each character of the input String.

## Usage

The Runner class contains a simple main method used to interact with each of the algorithms listed
above.

An object is instantiated from each class, before the iterative and the recursive method from each
class is called. Arbitrary values are passed to each method, which can be edited here to alter
the output.

Finally, the output of each of the methods is printed to the console.
